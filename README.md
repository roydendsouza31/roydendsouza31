Full stack web developer and aspiring cybersecurity expert
----------------------------------------------------------

Passionate coder with 5 years of experience, I started my journey with the C programming language and learned other languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript along the way. My early interest in IoT led me to create a couple of exciting projects in that field, such as a quadcopter, a robotic spider, and a fitness band. Over time, I discovered my enthusiasm for web development, and I've been honing my skills and building intriguing projects ever since. I also have a keen interest in cybersecurity and networking, constantly exploring and learning new things in these areas. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
